# 🚀 Keras Hub  

## 🔥 Overview  
This repository showcases hands-on experiments using **Google's Teachable Machine** and **TensorFlow Hub with Keras**. It is divided into two parts:  
- **Part A**: Building interactive AI models using **Teachable Machine** for text, image, and video classification.  
- **Part B**: Implementing and modifying Keras Hub examples at **different difficulty levels** for **both text and image tasks**.

## 📌 Part A: Teachable Machine Experiments  
In this section, we explore three unique **Teachable Machine models**, leveraging **Google's no-code ML platform**.  

| Experiment | Description | 
|------------|-------------|
| 📝 **Text Classification** | Train a model to classify different text inputs using Teachable Machine |
| 🖼️ **Image Recognition** | Build an image classifier using custom images and fine-tuned layers |
| 📹 **Video Action Detection** | Detect and classify actions in videos using Teachable Machine |

## 📌 Part B: Keras Hub Experiments  
This section contains **8 Colab notebooks**, covering **Easy, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert** levels for both **text and image tasks**. Each notebook implements **small variations** of existing Keras-Hub examples, adding unique modifications.  

### 🖼️ Image-Based Models  
| Level | Experiment | Description | 
|--------|------------|-------------|
| ✅ **Easy** | Image Classification with Transfer Learning | Modify a pre-trained image classifier | 
| 🚀 **Intermediate** | Style Transfer with Deep Learning | Apply artistic styles to images using CNNs | 
| 🔥 **Advanced** | Object Detection with Faster R-CNN | Detect multiple objects in real-time images | 
| 🏆 **Expert** | GANs for Image Generation | Train a GAN to generate new images |

### 📜 Text-Based Models  
| Level | Experiment | Description | 
|--------|------------|-------------|
| ✅ **Easy** | Text Classification with Pretrained Embeddings | Classify IMDB reviews using Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) | 
| 🚀 **Intermediate** | Named Entity Recognition (NER) | Identify names, locations, and entities in text | 
| 🔥 **Advanced** | Text Summarization with Transformer Models | Generate short summaries from long articles | 
| 🏆 **Expert** | Question Answering with BERT | Fine-tune a BERT model for Q&A tasks |
